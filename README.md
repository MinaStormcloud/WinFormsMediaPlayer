# MediaPlayer
Code for a WinForms media player. Please note that NETFX 4.7.2 or NETFX 4.8 Tools are required for this build. Download and install ndp472-devpack-enu and/or ndp48-devpack-enu. If Visual Studio warns of a missing folder in the "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v10.0A\bin\NETFX 4.8 Tools" folder, it is possible to copy the "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v10.0A\bin\NETFX 4.7.2 Tools" folder and rename it to "NETFX 4.8 Tools".
